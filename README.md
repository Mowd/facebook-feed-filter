```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### How It Works

The extension uses content scripts to:
1. Monitor DOM changes using MutationObserver
2. Identify sponsored/suggested content through text matching
3. Find the parent article container and hide it
4. Display a placeholder showing what was filtered

### File Structure

### Performance Optimizations

- **Debouncing**: Processes changes in batches every 500ms
- **WeakSet Tracking**: Prevents reprocessing of already filtered elements
- **Selective Scanning**: Only processes new elements added to the DOM
